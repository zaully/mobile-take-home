### User Stories

- [x] The first thing a user should see is a list of episodes.
- [x] If the user taps into an episode the app has to display a list of characters with a clear distinction between dead and alive characters
- [x] If the user taps into a character the app has to display that character's information and picture
- [x] Bonus functionality: The user should have the ability to kill a character and if a character gets kill the character lists should update accordingly (they can be killed by swiping the character to the right in the Characters screen)
