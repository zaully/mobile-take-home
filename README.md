# Guestlogix Take Home Test - Mobile

At Guestlogix we feel that putting developers on the spot with advanced algorithmic puzzles doesn’t exactly highlight one’s true skillset. The intention of this assessment is to see how you approach and tackle a problem in the real world, not quivering in front of a whiteboard.

### What is the test?

You will be building a Xamarin application to draw a route on a map between two (or more) airports. Included in this repository is a set of Airport, Airline, and Route data. Your task is to provide the user with a form to enter the origin and destination airports and display a route that connects them (if any).

### User Stories

- As a user I can enter IATA codes of an origin and a destination airport and view a path between the two on a map. Airports in the data set with a null IATA code are provided in the dataset for the sake of completeness, and may be omitted.
- As a user I am provided meaningful feedback should no route exist between the airports.
- As a user I am provided meaningful feedback if information entered is incorrect.

### Requirements

In the spirit of Xamarin, the application should run on at least two different platforms. You may use either Forms or native views to create your UI. Otherwise, you have complete freedom in terms of how you implement the solution, as long as all user requirements are met.

### Submitting

1. Fork this repository and provide your solution.
2. Run through it one last time to make sure it works!
3. Send an email to indicate that you have completed the challenge. 

### Questions

If you have any questions during the challenge feel free to email Peter Samsonov at psamsonov@guestlogix.com. Whether it be a question about the requirements, submitting, anything, just send the email!
